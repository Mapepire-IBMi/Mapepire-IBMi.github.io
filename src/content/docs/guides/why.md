Mapepire (pronounced 'mapəpɪə' or 'MAH-pup-ee') is a database access layer written on top of secure web sockets. It was built to make developing modern applications in .NET Core, Node.js, PHP, and the likes, easier when using Db2 for i.

Mapepire brings an unprecedented level of simplicity for Db2 access. All communication with the server is done through a single port, and there is no need to install external drivers or other native software on the client machine. This makes it an ideal choice for deployment of cloud-native applications, running seamlessly in [Red Hat UBI](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image) deployments, [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) containers, and the magnitude of cloud services available (like IBM Cloud, Vercel, AWS, or Azure).
